Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses. In search of better performance, researchers have combined recommendation techniques to build hybrid recommender systems. This chapter surveys the space of two-part hybrid recommender systems, comparing four different recommendation techniques and seven different hybridization strategies. Implementations of 41 hybrids including some novel combinations are examined and compared. The study finds that cascade and augmented hybrids work well, especially when combining two components of differing strengths.},

@article{Pan2008,
	abstract = {Many applications of collaborative filtering (CF), such as news item recommendation and bookmark recommendation, are most naturally thought of as one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) problems. In these problems, the training data usually consist simply of binary data reflecting a user's action or inaction, such as page visitation in the case of news item recommendation or webpage bookmarking in the bookmarking scenario. Usually this kind of data are extremely sparse (a small fraction are positive examples), therefore ambiguity arises in the interpretation of the non-positive examples. Negative examples and unlabeled positive examples are mixed together and we are typically unable to distinguish them. For example, we cannot really attribute a user not bookmarking a page to a lack of interest or lack of awareness of the page. Previous research addressing this one-class problem only considered it as a classification task. In this paper, we consider the one-class problem under the CF setting. We propose two frameworks to tackle OCCF. One is based on weighted low rank approximation; the other is based on negative example sampling. The experimental results show that our approaches significantly outperform the baselines.},

@article{braunhofer:2017,
	abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems are information filtering and decision support applications that generate recommendations by exploiting context-dependent user preference data, such as ratings augmented with the description of the contextual situation detected when the user experienced the item. In fact, many contextual factors (e.g., weather, season, mood or companion) may potentially affect the user's experience of an item, but not all of them are equally important for the recommender system performance, or easy to be automatically acquired. Hence, it is important to identify and collect only those factors that truly affect the user preferences (ratings) and can improve the effectiveness of the recommendations computed by the recommender system. Extending our previous work, in this paper, we propose a novel method which adaptively elicits the most useful factors from the user upon rating an item. The proposed method deems a contextual factor as useful to be elicited when a user is rating an item, if it has an impact on the user's predicted rating for that item. The results of our offline experiments, which we executed on travel-related rating datasets, show that the proposed method performs better than other state-of-the-art context selection methods. This paper is an extended and updated version of a conference paper titled ‘Contextual Information Elicitation in Travel Recommender Systems' previously published in the proceedings of Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2016 Conference (ENTER 2016) held in Bilbao, Spain, February 2–5, 2016.},

This approach supports multiple dimensions, profiling information, and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations. The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments. A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made, and the tradeoffs between the two are studied. Moreover, the article introduces a combined rating estimation method, which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the standard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere. Finally, the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach, using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance.},

We derive an EM approach that clusters observed trajectories by inferring the objectives for each cluster using any of several possible IRL methods, and then uses the constructed clusters to quickly identify the intent of a trajectory. We show that a natural approach to IRL - a gradient ascent method that modifies reward parameters to maximize the likelihood of the observed trajectories - is successful at quickly identifying unknown reward functions. We demonstrate these ideas in the context of apprenticeship learning by acquiring the preferences of a human driver in a simple highway car simulator. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

	abstract = { I estimate a dynamic, stochastic model of smoking, expectations, and health that makes explicit channels through which an individual may learn about the health risks of smoking. Simulations of the structural model suggest that cardiovascular biomarker information at repeated health exams does not significantly alter smoking behavior because (a) signals of biomarker health are noisy within individuals, (b) the influence of biomarkers on major health outcomes is small, and (c) cigarette smoking is addictive. This paper also presents evidence of selection in smoking that, when not modeled, may cause an overstatement of the effect of smoking on expected longevity. }

These trajectories do not only connect locations in the physical world but also bridge the gap between people and locations. This paper introduces a social networking service, called GeoLife, which aims to understand trajectories, locations and users, and mine the correlation between users and locations in terms of user-generated GPS trajectories. GeoLife offers three key applications scenarios: 1) sharing life experiences based on GPS trajectories; 2) generic travel recommendations, e.g., the top interesting locations, travel sequences among locations and travel experts in a given region; and 3) personalized friend and location recommendation.},

@article{yao:2015,
	abstract = {With recent advances in radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor networks, and Web services, physical things are becoming an integral part of the emerging ubiquitous Web. Finding correlations of ubiquitous things is a crucial prerequisite for many important applications such as things search, discovery, classification, recommendation, and composition. This article presents DisCor-T, a novel graph-based method for discovering underlying connections of things via mining the rich content embodied in human-thing interactions in terms of user, temporal and spatial information. We model these various information using two graphs, namely spatio-temporal graph and social graph. Then, random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to find proximities among things, and a relational graph of things (RGT) indicating implicit correlations of things is learned. The correlation analysis lays a solid foundation contributing to improved effectiveness in things management. To demonstrate the utility, we develop a flexible feature-based classification framework on top of RGT and perform a systematic case study. Our evaluation exhibits the strength and feasibility of the proposed approach.},

And the latest application cases are also surveyed. As more and more devices connected to IoT, large volume of data should be analyzed, the latest algorithms should be modified to apply to big data. We reviewed these algorithms and discussed challenges and open research issues. At last a suggested big data mining system is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2015 Feng Chen et al.},

	abstract = {The actual development of the Internet of Things (IoT) needs major issues related to things' service discovery and composition to be addressed. This paper proposes a possible approach to solve such issues. We introduce a novel paradigm of "social network of intelligent objects", namely the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), based on the notion of social relationships among objects. Following the definition of a possible social structure among objects, a preliminary architecture for the implementation of SIoT is presented. Through the SIoT paradigm, the capability of humans and devices to discover, select, and use objects with their services in the IoT is augmented. Besides, a level of trustworthiness is enabled to steer the interaction among the billions of objects which will crowd the future IoT.},
